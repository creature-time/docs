CreatureTime developers must use this documentation as a guideline for our producing avatars.
# Workflow

> - All edits should be one directional.
> - All steps should only happen previously before their successor.
>   - Steps may be skipped for prototyping.

## Flow

| Step                                          | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ZBrush                                        | *We may use other high res modeling software.*                                                                                                                                                                |
| Multiresolution Modifier                      | *We MUST project any high res to a low res to allow the client to make edits or changes if they want without depending on other software. Any other sculpting or projection fixes may be done at this stage.* |
| [UV Unwrap](#uv-unwrap) & [Rigging](#rigging) | *[UV Unwrap](#uv-unwrap) and [Rigging](#rigging) can be done in parallel.*                                                                                                                                    |
| FBX Import, Shaders, Materials, Textures      | *Connect generated textures to materials and materials to the FBX.*                                                                                                                                           |

## UV Unwrap

| Step              | Notes                                                                                                                             |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UV Unwrap         | *UV unwrapping and rigging can be done in parallel.*                                                                              |
| Normal Baking     | *Normal baking for Substance Painter. This gives us more control over the normal baking when using the Multiresolution Modifier.* |
| Texture Baking    | *Sometimes we may bake textures out of Blender for usage further in the pipeline.*                                                |
| Substance Painter |                                                                                                                                   |

## Rigging

| Step            | Notes                            |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------- |
| Rigging         | *Set up the armature and bones.* |
| Weight Painting |                                  |

# Preparing for Release

## Blender File

> - The data names should match the object name in the Blender scene.
> * The *Blender File* should contain only the bare minimum for the package. 
> * Blender files should be saved with compression.
> * Images should be *packed* into the Blender file.
> * Anything unnecessary in the following should be removed from the distributed files:
>     * External file references  
>     * Third-party data (*RetopoFlow*â€™s text file, for example.)  
>     * Actions  
>     * Images  
>     * Meshes  
>     * Shape keys  
>     * Texts/Scripts  
>     * Worlds

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Should NOT require third-party plug-ins to open and modify. 

### Armatures

> - Naming should follow the following pattern: \[Prefix\]\[BoneName\]\[Suffix\].
> - Bones with multiple bones for length should have a suffix greater than 0: *\[Prefix\]\[BoneName\]\[BoneNumber\]*.
> - We may use the suffix *root* for animated bones like ears and tail to separate their physics and animations: *\[Prefix\]\[BoneName\]Root*.
> - Symmetrical bones should end with additional \_L for Left and \_R for Right.
> - We should NOT export automatic tip bones for the FBX. However, if we need tip bones, we should export them with the suffix Tip.

#### Humanoid Bones

##### Body

> [!CAUTION]
> Ignore Upper Chest. Weight Painting under the breasts variants without compensation.


> [!NOTE]
> Toes can be ignored. They are not necessary for the avatar unless there is a gain for assigning the toes for that specific avatar.

> - We use the NLA Strips for exporting animations. Modify the actions until the action is finalized then add it to the NLA Strip.

> [!CAUTION]
> Ensure that the final animation in the NLA strip list is the export pose of the FBX. If it is not last in the list, the default pose in Unity will be what is the final animation.

## Substance File

> - Names for exported textures should follow the following pattern: *\[Mesh\]\_\[MapName\]\[Suffix\]\[UDIM\]*.
> - Substance files should have layers that are properly named and organized.
> - Texture Sets should be baked out at the same resolution as the exported files.
> - All textures should be exported as 8-bit unless otherwise stated.
>     - Normal maps should be exported as 16 bit.
>     - Emissive maps may be exported with 8-bit \+ dithering.

### Map Naming Convention

| Map Name | Map Name | Map Type |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Base Color | BaseColor | RBG/RGBA |
| Ambient Occlusion | AmbientOcclusion | Grayscale |
| Emission | Emission | RBG |
| Metallic Smoothness | MetallicSmoothness | Composite |
| Metallic Smoothness Standard | MetallicSmoothness\_Standard | Composite |
| Normal | Normal | Normal |
| Global Mask | GlobalMask\[1-4\] | Composite |

> [!NOTE]
> Any maps not mentioned above should follow the same naming convention as above.

## Unity Package

> - Create a dedicated exportable scene within the project that contains everything for that package to properly export.
>   - Do NOT export the export scene.
> - The package should NOT contain any third-party files when exporting.

### Package Structure

> - Other directories within *CreatureTime/Avatars/\[ProjectName\]*:
> - These directories are followed in most cases. If the directory is not mentioned, try to follow a similar convention.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not use texture compression unless you absolutely have to since this may cause hitches when people are loading the avatar in VRChat.

### Materials

> - Naming should follow the following pattern: *\[ModelFileName\]-\[MaterialName\].* Allows for FBX Import to auto-map using *On Demand Remap* feature.

### FBX Import

> - Naming should follow the following pattern: \[ProjectName\]\_\[Variant\].

#### Animation

> - Animation names should follow the Action naming convention from the FBX: *\[ActionName\]*.
> - When there are multiple animations exported from a single animation from the FBX, the animation name may have the sub animation context added to the name: *\[ActionName\]\_\[SubAnimation\]*.
> - Masks may be used to generate masked animations.
> - Transformation animations should be cleaned up if they have sub properties are not being used. Scale or Position, for example.

# Project Structure

> - The root of the project is also the root of the Unity project.


> [!WARNING]
> Due to LFS not sufficient for large source files, .Source files and large content file types are ignored (including their backup files). Currently, committed into a private Google Drive, but need to find a better solution.

Only need to commit the following directories into version control.

- *\[ProjectName\]*
	- Assets/CreatureTime/Avatars/*\[AvatarName\]*
		- Models/.Source
